to see databases - show dbs
create db/start working in db - use _DbName
but new db will show only if we have 1 collection in db
db.data.insertOne() or insertMany()({name:"react", type:"Fe", videos:80, active:true}) - will return id and acknowledged & creates collection as data and 1 document in it
now show dbs will show created db
db will show current db
cls will clear console 

show collections will show collections in db
db.data.find() will show data in collection
db.data.find().pretty() will show data in collection in good format
db.data.find({name:"react"}).pretty() will show specific data/document in collection 
db.data.find({name:"react"}, {name:1}).pretty() will show specific data/document in collection that too only 1 field only name not type/videos/active but with id
db.data.find({name:"react"}, {_id:0, name:1}).pretty() will show specific data/document in collection that too only 1 field only name not type/videos/active but without id
db.data.find({active:"true"}).pretty().limit(1) or db.data.findOne({active:"true"}) will show first document with active value true 1 is chanagable in limit para.
db.data.find({active:"true"}).pretty().limit(1).skip(1) will show the first encountered document with active value but by skipping first document so logically second.

db.data.updateOne({name:"react"}, {$set:{type:"Frontend"}}) or updateMany() will update the type of first encountered document with name react

db.data.deleteMany({type:"Frontend"}) will delete every document having type frontend
db.data.deleteMany({}) will delete every document in collection(data)
